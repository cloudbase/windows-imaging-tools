Windows Imaging Tools
===============================
[![Master branch](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/cloudbase/windows-openstack-imaging-tools?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ader1990/windows-openstack-imaging-tools-w885m)

Windows OpenStack Imaging Tools automates the generation of Windows images.<br/>
The tools are a bundle of PowerShell modules and scripts.

The supported target environments for the Windows images are:
* OpenStack with KVM, Hyper-V, VMware and baremetal hypervisor types
* MAAS with KVM, Hyper-V, VMware and baremetal

The generation environment needs to be a Windows one, with Hyper-V virtualization enabled.<br/>
If you plan to run the online Windows setup step on another system / hypervisor, the Hyper-V virtualization is not required.

The following versions of Windows images (both x86 / x64, if existent) to be generated are supported:
* Windows Server 2008 / 2008 R2
* Windows Server 2012 / 2012 R2
* Windows Server 2016
* Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10

To generate Windows Nano Server 2016, please use the following repository:

## Fast path to create a Windows image

### Requirements:

* A Windows host, with Hyper-V virtualization enabled, PowerShell >=v4 support<br/>
and Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK)
* A Windows installation ISO or DVD
* Windows compatible drivers, if required by the target environment
* Git environment

### Steps to generate the Windows image
* Clone this repository
* Mount or extract the Windows ISO file
* Download and / or extract the Windows compatible drivers
* If the target environment is MAAS or the image generation is configured to install updates,<br/>
the windows-curtin-hooks and WindowsUpdates git submodules are required.<br/>
Run `git submodule update --init` to retrieve them
* Import the WinImageBuilder.psm1 module
* Use the New-WindowsCloudImage or New-WindowsOnlineCloudImage methods with <br/> the appropriate configuration options

### PowerShell image generation example for OpenStack KVM (host requires Hyper-V enabled)
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/cloudbase/windows-openstack-imaging-tools.git --recursive
pushd windows-openstack-imaging-tools
Import-Module .\WinImageBuilder.psm1

# The Windows image file path that will be generated
$windowsImagePath = "C:\images\my-windows-image.qcow2"

# The wim file path is the installation image on the Windows ISO
$wimFilePath = "D:\Sources\install.wim"

# Every Windows ISO can contain multiple Windows flavors like Core, Standard, Datacenter
# Usually, the first image version is the Core one
$image = (Get-WimFileImagesInfo -WimFilePath $wimFilePath)[0]

New-WindowsOnlineImage -WimFilePath $wimFilePath -ImageName $image.ImageName `
    -WindowsImagePath $windowsImagePath -Type 'KVM' -InstallUpdates `
    -SizeBytes 30GB -CpuCores 4 -Memory 4GB -SwitchName 'external'

popd

```

## Image generation workflow

### New-WindowsCloudImage

This command does not require Hyper-V to be enabled, but the generated image<br/>
is not ready to be deployed, as it needs to be started manually on another hypervisor.<br/>
The image is ready to be used when it shuts down.

You can find a PowerShell example to generate a raw OpenStack Ironic image that also works on KVM<br/>
in `Examples/create-windows-cloud-image.ps1`

### New-WindowsOnlineImage
This command requires Hyper-V to be enabled, a VMSwitch to be configured for external<br/>
network connectivity if the updates are to be installed, which is highly recommended.

This command uses internally the `New-WindowsCloudImage` to generate the base image and<br/>
start a Hyper-V instance using the base image. After the Hyper-V instance shuts down, <br/>
the resulting VHDX is shrinked to a minimum size and converted to the required format.

in `Examples/create-windows-online-cloud-image.ps1`


## For developers

### Running unit tests

You will need PowerShell Pester package installed on your system.

It should already be installed on your system if you are running Windows 10.<br/>
If it is not installed you can install it on Windows 10 or greater:

```powershell
Install-Package Pester
```

or you can clone it from: https://github.com/pester/Pester


Running the tests in a closed environment:

```cmd
cmd /c 'powershell.exe -NonInteractive { Invoke-Pester }'
```

This will run all tests without polluting your current shell environment. <br/>
This is not needed if you run it in a Continuous Integration environment.
