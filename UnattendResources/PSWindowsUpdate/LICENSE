All Software that is made available to download from the web site is the copyrighted work of Microsoft or its suppliers. Your use of Software is governed by the terms of the license agreement, if any, that accompanies or is included with the Software.

If any Software contains a copyright notice or similar indication of ownership that indicates it is owned by someone other than Microsoft, and it includes its own license agreement, then that Software is licensed to you by that other party and not Microsoft, and Microsoft grants you no intellectual property rights (express or implied) with respect to that Software. 

If Microsoft makes any Software marked as “sample” or “example” available on this web site without a license agreement, then it is licensed to you under the terms of the Microsoft Limited Public License. 

If Microsoft makes any other Software available on this web site without a license agreement, you may use it solely to design, develop and test your programs to run on Microsoft products and services.

If any Content is made available to you on this web site without a license agreement, then you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Content for your internal use in designing, developing, and testing your software, products and services. You must preserve the below copyright notice in all copies of the Content and ensure that both the copyright notice and this permission notice appear in those copies. 

Accredited educational institutions, such as K-12 schools, universities, private or public colleges, and state community colleges, may download and reproduce Content for distribution in the classroom for educational purposes. Publication or distribution outside the classroom requires express written permission. 

Except as provided above in this section, no portion of the web site may be copied, imitated, published, transmitted, broadcast or distributed, in whole or in part.

Certain portions of this web site are accessible only to users who are invited to participate, for example as part of a program for using pre-release Software and providing feedback to Microsoft. All information available in those portions of this web site or concerning Content or Software available in those portions of this web site are confidential information of Microsoft. For a period of five years from the time you accessed this confidential information, you may not disclose this confidential information to any third party. This restriction will not apply to any information that is or becomes publicly available without a breach of this restriction, was lawfully known to the receiver of the information without an obligation to keep it confidential, is received from another source who can disclose it lawfully and without an obligation to keep it confidential, or is independently developed. You may disclose this confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law. Before doing so, you must seek the highest level of protection available and, when possible, give Microsoft enough prior notice to provide a reasonable chance to seek a protective order.
